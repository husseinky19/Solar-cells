<h1> PEROVSKITE SOLAR CELL </h1>
<p><img class="imagesi" src="download.jpeg"height="300"width="300" title="peroskite" alt="peroskite"></p>
<p class="para"> Perovskite solar cells (PCSs) are composed of organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite as the light harvester. Since the first report on a long-term-durable, 9.7 % efficient, solid-state perovskite solar cell, organic–inorganic halide perovskites have received considerable attention because of their excellent optoelectronic properties. As a result, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 22 % was certified (Cho and park., 2017). PSC consists of a perovskite absorbing material sandwiched between electron transporting layer (ETL) and hole-transporting layer (HTL) along with the transparent conducting oxide substrate, Fluorine, doped tin oxide. (FTO) and a top electrode such as gold, silver (Ameen et al., 2015).</p>
<h1> Introduction</h1>
<p class="para">.
Fossil fuels must be replaced by clean and renewable energy in order to reduce
environmental pollution and meet an increase in global energy demands [1–4]. Solar energy
is one of the most encouraging, abundant, green, and renewable sources for decreasing
or even replacing traditional energy in the future. The energy provided by the sun in one
hour is sufficient to supply the Earth’s needs for an entire year [5].
Various innovative photovoltaic technologies have been developed to capture and
convert solar energy into electricity, but affordable solar cells with high power conversion
efficiency are needed. One of the frontrunner technologies uses inorganic and organic
hybrid compounds (CH3NH3-PbX3, X = I, Br, Cl) with the crystal structure of perovskite.
Photovoltaic solar cells utilizing such light absorbers are called perovskite solar cells
(PSCs). Some of the PSCs’ favorable attributes compared to conventional solar cells such
as the silicon-based rigid modules include ease of fabrication [6], diversity in device architectures [7], small energy band gaps, high carrier mobility [8], panchromatic sunlight
absorption, superior carrier diffusion length, and long carrier lifetimes [7,9]. Unlike silicon,
which only absorbs light near the red end of the visible light spectrum, </p>
<h1>2.5 ELECTRON TRANSPORT LAYER (ETL)</h1>
<p id="paragraph"> The primary function of an ETL is to extract a photo generated electron from perovskite and then transfer to electrodes. The basic criterion for an ideal ETL is high optical transmittance, excellent electron mobility, high conductivity, and an appropriate work function. ETL also performs as hole-blocking layer (HBL) (Tuant et al., 2017). The configuration and the choice of ETL are essential factors to understand the electronic mechanisms in PSCs, which control processes such as carrier separation, extraction, transport, and the recombination (Ameen et al., 2015). The electron transport layer (ETL) plays a crucial role in extracting and transporting photogenerated electron carriers and serves as a hole-blocking layer by suppressing charge recombination as one of the most important components for photovoltaic devices. The physical properties of the ETL, including charge mobility, energy level alignment, defect states, morphology, and related interfacial properties, are significant for the photovoltaic performance. Until now, TiO2 has been widely used as the ETL material for organic/inorganic PSCs  However, TiO2 shows some limitations as a stable and efficient ETL for PSCs. TiO2 decomposes under the exposure to ultraviolet (UV) for a long time, which is not suitable for commercialization of PSCs High temperature annealing for processing. TiO2 also hampers elaborate device fabrication. Defect trap states such as oxygen vacancy in TiO2 increases non-radiative loss and degrade the device performance.  Many experimental efforts have been paid to overcome the limitations of TiO2 and to find novel ETL materials, including SnO2, La-doped BaSnO, and ZnO2 among many candidates, SnO2 has shown an excellent chemical stability, UV-resistance, superior band alignment, high charge extraction, and less photocatalytic activity compared with TiO2 or other ETLs. UV spectroscopy and femtosecond transient absorption measurement showed that SnO2 exhibits the better electron extraction than TiO2. Since SnO2 has a large band gap (Eg) ~3.6 eV (vs. Eg(TiO2) ~3.0 eV), most of visible lights pass through SnO2. SnO2 prohibits absorption of UV because of the large bandgap (Eg), protecting it from UV exposure. In addition, the bulk electron mobility in SnO2 is two orders of magnitude higher than that of TiO2. SnO2 is easily processed at low-temperature, which is suitable for large-scale commercialization. (Kim and chang., 2020).</p>
Although SnO2 has been used as an alternative ETL for PSCs till now, the electron extraction mechanism of SnO2-based PSCs has not been studied yet (Kim and chang., 2020).
